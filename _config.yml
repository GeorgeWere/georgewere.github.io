# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

Define actors, for each entity, who will be involved into the crisis cell. These actors should be documented in a contact list kept permanently up to date.
Make sure that analysis tools are up, functional (EDR, Antivirus, IDS, logs analyzers), not compromised, and up-to-date.
Make sure to have architecture map of your networks.
Make sure that an up-to-date inventory of the assets is available.
Perform a continuous security watch and inform the people in charge of security about the threat trends.
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
