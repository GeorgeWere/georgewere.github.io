title: "HTB: PHOTOBOMB (10.10.11.182)"
description: "Shibboleth is a medium machine from HackTheBox created by knightmare & mrb3n. It starts off with a static website template. We will find a clue to look into BMC automation then find IPMI listening on UDP port 632. I will use Metasploit to leak a hash from IPMI, and crack it to get creds. This creds will allow me to log into Zabbix instance. Once in Zabbix i will use the Zabbix agent to execute commands and gain initial foothold. I will use credential reuse to pivots the next user. To get root, Iâ€™ll exploit a CVE in MariaDB / MySQL."

## RECON
### Nmap

As always we start off with the recon and enumeration process to get an overview of our attack surface and target's running service.

We run NMAP with default scripts and enumerate version and save it in the directory called nmap.
