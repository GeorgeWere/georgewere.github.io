title: "HTB: AI (10.10.10.163)"
description: "AI was a box themed after smart speakers like Echo and Google Home. I’ll find a web interface that accepts sound files, and use that to find SQL injection that I have to pass using words. Of course I’ll script the creation of the audio files, and use that to dump credentials from the database that I can use to access the server. For privesc, I’ll find an open Java Debug port on Tomcat running as root, and use that to get a shell."

## RECON
### Nmap

As always we start off with the recon and enumeration process to get an overview of our attack surface and target's running service.

We run NMAP with default scripts and enumerate version and save it in the directory called nmap.

```nmap

```
From the result we only see one port open. Also, we note nmap was not redirected. Lets add shibboleth.htb to our hosts file and run the scan again.

```nmap

```
