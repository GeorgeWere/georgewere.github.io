title: "HTB: MIRAI (10.10.10.48)"
description: "Mirai is an easy linux box from hack the box hosting a plex media server and running raspberry pi OS. The raspberry has its default credentials still intact. To escalate privileges, the user pi has the ability to execute sudo commands as root without needing any additional credentials. While this may seem straightforward, there's a twist. The root.txt flag isn't readily available in the root directory. Instead, you have to retrieve the deleted flag from a USB drive attached to the box."

## RECON
### Nmap

As always we start off with the recon and enumeration process to get an overview of our attack surface and target's running service.

Given the [OpenSSH Version](https://launchpad.net/debian/+source/openssh/1:6.7p1-5+deb8u4) The box is probably running debian 8 jesse.

### Port enumeration

#### TCP Port 53 (DNS)

When DNS listens on `TCP` it is usually to facilitate `zone transfer`

Without a valid `hostname` or `domain name` I couldint do a `zone` transfer. I tried guesing from the box name but none worked.

#### Port 80

Visiting the page, I see a blank page.

![Blank Page](/assets/img/mirai/blank_page.png)

I proxy the request to `BurpSuite` and note a farmilia header `X-Pi-hole` which is a `DNS sinkhole` porpulary associated with `raspberry pi`. I'll note that and use it for later.

I will fire gobuster and bruteforce for directories

`gobuster` Finds two directories and then errors out.

#### /admin

Admin page redirects to a `Pi-hole` dashboard page.

![Admin Page](/assets/img/mirai/admin.png)

Also there is a 'login' page but I dont have any credentials to try out. All default credentials dont work.

![Login Page](/assets/img/mirai/login.png)

#### TCP Port 32400

Visiting this page I come across login page for [Plex Server](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/).

![Plex Login](/assets/img/mirai/plex_index.png)

`Plex Server` is a media server kind of like `netflix` where you set up a server and just upload your media be it movies,series or music and create accounts for people you want to share with to access.

I will register for an account and log in. Nothing intresting so far except for the settings page where I get a version number. The version doesnt do much as I am unable to find an exploit.

## Shell as pi

#### Mirai

According to [Cloud Flare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/), `Mirai` is a malware that scans the Internet for IoT devices that run on the ARC processor. This processor runs a stripped-down version of the Linux operating system. If the default username-and-password combo is not changed, Mirai is able to log into the device and infect it.

IoT, short for Internet of Things, is just a fancy term for smart devices that can connect to the Internet. These devices can be baby monitors, vehicles, network routers, agricultural devices, medical devices, environmental monitoring devices, home appliances, DVRs, CC cameras, headset, or smoke detectors.

#### Default credentials

The default credentials for `raspberry pi` is `pi` and `raspberry`. I will try this out and guess what, we are in

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

Since we have credentials, we can check our `sudo` privileges.

```sh
pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo -l

At this point I thought wow that was pretty simple. Let me grab the root file and call it a day. Oh how wrong I was.

```sh
root@raspberrypi:~# cat root.txt
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
```
### Recovering Deleted data

`USB` mount on Linux are usually in `/media`. Using `lsblk` I can see the raw device is in `/dev/sdb`

```sh
root@raspberrypi:/# lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   10G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0  1.3G  0 part /lib/live/mount/persistence/sda1
└─sda2   8:2    0  8.7G  0 part /lib/live/mount/persistence/sda2
sdb      8:16   0   10M  0 disk /media/usbstick
sr0     11:0    1 1024M  0 rom  
loop0    7:0    0  1.2G  1 loop /lib/live/mount/rootfs/filesystem.squashfs
```
The directory has a single file `./damnit.txt` and an empty `./lost+found`.

#### Using strings

The strings command looks for printable strings in an object or binary file. A string is any sequence of 4 or more printable characters that end with a new-line or a null character. The strings command is useful for identifying random object files.

I will use `strings` to try and find if I can see any since I know the flag is a string.

```sh
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# strings /dev/sdb             
>r &                                                                                                             
/media/usbstick

Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.                                           
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

This is just one of the ways to recover the flag.

And thats the box. Thank you all for taking your time to read my blog post, stay tuned for the next!

Happy hacking!
