description: "HTB SHIBBOLETH (10.10.11.124) MACHINE WRITE UP Shibboleth is a medium machine from HackTheBox created by knightmare & mrb3n. It starts off with a static website template. We will find a clue to look into BMC automation then find IPMI listening on UDP port 632. I will use Metasploit to leak a hash from IPMI, and crack it to get creds. This creds will allow me to log into Zabbix instance. Once in Zabbix i will use the Zabbix agent to execute commands and gain initial foothold. I will use credential reuse to pivots the next user. To get root, I’ll exploit a CVE in MariaDB / MySQL."

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

```bash
echo test > test.php
```
```bash
echo test > test.php
```
